# Media Collage

To add a Media Collage section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content of your section is created by adding blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Adding more than one block will automatically generate the collage layout. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

### Video media

The section supports both images and videos. Note that the videos here will auto play with no sound. They should be understood as a cosmetic background element more than an informative video, just to give more dynamism to your design. A “moving image” in a way. If you do have a video that you want to showcase, and which you’d like to be viewed in a player with sounds, you should then use the Video section instead.

**Styling pro tips**

That section gives you great control over how you want your text content to be laid out. You do so by customizing the “Text position on large screen” and “Text position on small screen” section settings. The section can be used with one, two, or three media by adding or deleting blocks. The layout will automatically adapt to form a “collage” grid.

**How to best use that section**

It is a very versatile section. Good use cases are when the section is displayed at full width on top of a page for a big visual impact. Especially when the transparent header is enabled. It can also be particularly useful as a smaller promotional banner featuring rich imagery and colors.
