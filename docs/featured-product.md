# Featured Product

To add a featured product section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout and content using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the Featured product section settings sidebar. The content of your section is determined by the blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

To edit the information about the product, you must exit the Theme Editor and go to your inventory in the Shopify admin by clicking on *Products*. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products).

**Why is that section useful**

It allows you to showcase a condensed version of your product page in a section that can be displayed on any other page.

**How to best use that section**

When used on a repeated template (for example the collection page template), you may want the section to showcase a different product of your own choosing rather than showing the same product over and over. There are two ways to achieve that: You can either create different collection page templates, or connect the collection from the section to a metafield.
