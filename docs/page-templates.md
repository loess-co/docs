_Video tutorial about page templates in Shopify_

Page templates can be useful when the sections you want to use on a page are not relevant for **every instance of that page**. For example, you might want to add a section about technical specifications of a product, but you don’t want the same specifications for all products. But unless you use different templates, the same sections and blocks will be displayed regardless of the product.

#### To create a template:

**1- Go to the top bar** in the Theme Editor, and select **Create template** for the relevant page (Product, Collection, Page, Blog, or Blog post). You can then add sections and blocks to that template.

**2- Once this is done, you can go to the Shopify Admin** and assign the proper template to the resource of your choice. For example, you can go to a product, and assign it a template that contains the right sections and blocks relevant for that specific product.

#### \*Note that the templates you create must be from a PUBLISHED theme in order to be visible in the Shopify Admin when you want to assign them to a resource.

Because this is a more advanced topic, we recommend you read the Shopify help docs that explain all there is to know about [templates](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/templates).
