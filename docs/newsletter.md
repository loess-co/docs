# Newsletter

To add a newsletter section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout and content using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

If you prefer requesting newsletter signups with a popup, use the "Email popup" section instead.

**Why is this section useful**

Many merchants are enabling the more compact subscription form in the footer of their store instead of resorting to a standalone section. Some might prefer to leave the subscription form outside the footer to save space for other information. Some may also prefer the subscription signup form to not be displayed on every page (which is the case when it’s inside the footer). And then, some others may prefer to give the newsletter sign up more emphasis with a section, or a stand alone page that can be linked to. In the end, with all those available options, the decision is completely up to you!
