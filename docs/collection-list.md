# Collection List

To add a collection list section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout and content using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

To edit the information about the collections, such as their names and cover images, you must exit the Theme Editor and go to your collections in the Shopify admin, located under *Products*. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections).

**Styling pro tips**

It’s not always easy to customize your store when images are repurposed in different contexts because image cropping can sometimes cause problems. The collection's cover image is a good example of that. It is leveraged for collection cards in the collection list section and template, where a square or vertical aspect ratio is often preferred. But it’s also supported in the collection page header, where the preferred aspect ratio might very well be horizontal. Especially if you set up the collection header to be a full-width image background. If this is a problem for you, the theme gives you the ability to override the collection cover image in the template header, by connecting a Collection metafield.
