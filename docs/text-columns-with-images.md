# Text Columns With Images

To add a Text columns with images section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content of your section is created by adding Column blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

**How to best use that section**

When used on a repeated template (for example the product page template), you may want the section to showcase different content per product rather than showing the same text and images over and over. There are two ways to achieve that: You can either create different product page templates, or connect the column content from the section to metafields.
