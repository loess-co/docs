# Collapsible Content

To add a Collapsible Content section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content of your section is created by adding blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

The section supports two types of blocks, “Category” and “Tab”, which you can drag and drop to organize your content.

**Why is this section useful?**

You may need an FAQ page on your store. This section is especially useful to create multiple tabs separated by category headings. You may also find that section useful to simply display some information on a page in a compact way that optimizes the screen real estate. To create an FAQ page with tabs, go to the Theme Editor. Open the dropdown menu in the middle of the top bar, go to “Page”, and then “Create template”. This will open a blank page that you can customize by adding the Collapsible tabs section. You will have to exit the Theme Editor to create a menu item in your navigation to link to that page.
