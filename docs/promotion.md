# Promotion

To add a Promotion section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content of your section is created by adding blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

**Styling pro tips**

Your grid composition can be made of product shots, collection cover images, or any image you might have at hand. Note that you can enable the link on collection and product images. You can use that section with three to six images, and change their position by reordering the blocks in the sidebar. Combine images that together will set a particular tone or mood. Below are some examples as per viewed on large screen.

**Why that section is useful**

That section provides a dynamic grid that breaks the monotony on a page and catches the eye. It’s a good way to highlight a product or a collection in a rich visual way.

**How to best use that section**

When used on a repeated template (for example the product page template), you may want the section to showcase different content per product rather than showing the same text and images over and over. There are two ways to achieve that: You can either create different product page templates, or connect the column content from the section to metafields.
