# Customer Accounts

When Customer accounts are enabled, an icon is displayed in the header. This icon is a link that allows your customers to login. Shopify stores password-protected information about a customer's identity, order history, and current order status. Customer accounts is a feature of the Shopify Platform that you enable in your Admin. We recommend that you visit the [Shopify support docs](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts) if you need complete and detailed information about Customer accounts.
