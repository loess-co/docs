# Rich Text

To add a Rich Text section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content is created by adding blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

**Why is this section useful**

This section is useful whenever you need to insert some text in a page, and it gives you great control over the many text styles available in the theme. It supports the icon block, which gives you access to the exclusive icon library. And it also supports background images. You can also use that section to just display an image on your page.
