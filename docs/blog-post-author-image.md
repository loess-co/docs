# Blog Post Author Image

Loess themes support blog post author images. Authors are members of your staff. You can manage your staff in the Shopify admin, in the **Settings** (bottom left of the screen), and then in the **Users and permissions** tab. More about [managing staff](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/staff-accounts/create-staff-accounts). The staff must add their profil picture to their account:

When a blog post is created in the Shopify admin, there's a form field for you to define the author. You can assign the corresponding staff.

In the Theme Editor, you need to ensure the **Show author image** setting is enabled. That setting is located in the blog post page. In the left sidebar, find the **Main blog post** section, and click on the **Author and date** block. The block may not be already installed. If so, you can click on **Add block** and install it. This block can be reordered for the author and date to be displayed where you want it in the layout.

You can also enable author images whenever you add the **Blog posts** section:
