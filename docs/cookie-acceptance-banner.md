**Why is this section useful?**

The Cookie Law is a piece of privacy legislation that requires websites to get consent from visitors to store or retrieve any information on a computer, smartphone or tablet. It was designed to protect online privacy, by making consumers aware of how information about them is collected and used online, and [give them a choice](https://www.cookielaw.org/optanon-eprivacy/) to allow it or not. The banner ensures customers are made aware that the store is using cookies. Laws may vary depending on the country where you do business. It is your responsibility to make the proper verifications.
