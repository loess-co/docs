# Image Hotspots

To add an Image Hotspot section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content of your section is created by adding blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

### Hotspots

Up to 3 hotspots can be added per image. You customize them by using the block settings. You first need to select a product you want to associate with your image. Using the vertical and horizontal position sliders, move the hotspot dot at the right position on the image.

**Why is this section useful**

It is not rare in apparel to get your customers inspired by certain looks rather than individual products showcased separately. That section is a great way to leverage photoshoots with models wearing kits, or just to display beautiful pictures of your products with a quick access to add them to cart and complete a purchase. This section can also be useful for merchants selling any type of products, showcased as bundles in their photos.
