# Gift Cards

The theme provides a built-in Gift Card page template. To customize the Gift Card page in the Theme Editor, navigate to that template or use the dropdown in the middle of the top bar, under “Others”. Customize the main layout using the “Gift card” setting sidebar. That setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display.
