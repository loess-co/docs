# Featured Collection

To add a featured collection section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout and content using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

**How to best use that section**

The section makes it easy to highlight products from a collection. You can easily use it on any page. When used on a repeated template (for example the product page template), you may want the section to showcase a different collection of your own choosing rather than showing the same collection over and over. There are two ways to achieve that: You can either create different product page templates, or connect the collection from the section to a metafield.
