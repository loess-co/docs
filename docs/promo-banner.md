# Promo Banner

To add a Promo Banner section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The general look and feel of your section is customizable from the section settings sidebar. The content of your section is created by adding up to three blocks in the main sidebar on the left. Each of those blocks can be customized using their own setting sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. *Remember that blocks can be reordered using drag and drop in the sidebar, and deleted by clicking “Remove block” at the bottom of each block’s setting sidebar.*

**Why that section is useful**

Because of its small height, this section allows you to insert promotions into any page without using too much real estate. This is especially useful when you need to make the information visible on top of a page.

**How to best use that section**

The section makes it easy to highlight products, collections, or any other valuable information to your customers. You can easily use it on product or collection pages. For its content to be different depending on the page, you can either create different templates or use metafields.
