# Cart

The theme provides different options for your cart: Popup notification, Page redirect, or Cart drawer. To customize your cart, you must go to the **Theme Settings**, and find the **Cart** tab:

When the type of cart flow is set to Popup or Page redirect, your customers will eventually be presented the Cart page before checking out. To customize this template, you can use the dropdown menu at the top of the Theme Editor and leverage the setting sidebar:
