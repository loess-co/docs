# Complementary Products

If it's not done already, install the **Search & Discovery** free app (featured in the [App Store here](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery)). Once in the app, go to the **Customize recommended products** tab. Select products, and assign them Complementary products. Then, in the Theme Editor, add the **Complementary products block** to your product page, under the **Product information section**.

You must click on **Add recommendation**, and then select a product. Go the the **Add complementary product** section to associate it with complementary products. The theme will output up to 4 products per page.
