# Blog Posts Section

To add a blog posts section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout and content using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

To create blog posts, or edit blog posts and cover images, you must exit the Theme Editor and go to your *Blog posts* in the Shopify admin, located under *Online Store*. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/blogs/adding-a-blog).

### Author image

For an author image to be displayed when “Show author image” is enabled, you must ensure their profile is properly set up in the Shopify admin. To do so, go to *Settings* (located at the bottom left of the Shopify admin), and then go to the *Users and permissions tab*.

**Styling pro tips**

It’s not always easy to customize your store when images are repurposed in different contexts because image cropping can sometimes cause problems. The blog post cover image is a good example of that. It is leveraged for article cards in the Blog posts section and template, where a square aspect ratio is often preferred. But it’s also supported in the Blog post template header, where the preferred aspect ratio might very well be more horizontal. Especially if you set up the collection header to be a full-width image background. If this is a problem for you, the theme provides a few "Article header" layouts that help achieve successful results with all types of image ratios.
