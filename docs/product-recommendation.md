# Product Recommendation

To add a product recommendations section, click “Add section” in the main sidebar on the left. Then customize the layout using its setting sidebar. The section’s setting sidebar may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can delete the section by clicking “Remove section” at the bottom.

The products that are displayed in the section are based on products that are commonly purchased together or products in related collections. Product recommendations become more accurate over time as more order and product information becomes available. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/themes-by-shopify/vintage-themes/customizing-vintage-themes/product-recommendations) about dynamic recommendations
