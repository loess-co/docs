# Removing "Powered by Shopify" in Footer

Shopify does not support a setting in the Theme Editor to disable the “Powered by Shopify” text. If you do want to remove it anyways, these are the steps to follow:

- In the Admin, go to **Sales channel** > **Online store**

- Open the dropdown menu from the button labeled with the **three dots** (located near the published theme)

- Select **Edit default theme content**

Once there, use the search field and type in "Powered". This should bring you to the **Checkout & system** settings. In the **Links** field, add a space to remove the default label, and hit **Save**.
