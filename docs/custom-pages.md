# Custom Pages

To create a new blank page to which you can later add sections, use the dropdown in the middle of the top bar from the Theme Editor. Go to **Pages** and select **Create template**. You can hide the default content by clicking on the **eye** icon next to the **Page** section in the left sidebar if that’s what works for you. Add sections like you would do on any other page. Once saved, that page will be visible in your Shopify Admin under **Online Store**, and then **Pages** (but only if you created the template from a published theme). It will also be possible to reference that page in a menu item in your navigation.
