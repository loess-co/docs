# Announcement Bar

To customize the announcement bar, select “Announcement bar” in the left sidebar of the Theme Editor. Then use the settings from the announcement bar sidebar, which may be located on the right side of your screen if you're using a large display. You can also make the bar expandable by adding an announcement block from the main sidebar, and customizing it using its own sidebar settings.

**Why is this section useful?**

For some brands, it is important to display social icons on the top of their pages, utility links (language and currency), or special announcements. The announcement bar is designed to do so while optimizing real estate on the screen.

**How to best use that section?**

That section is visible on every page of your store, so it’s a great way to make important information visible for the customers. Because on Loess themes the announcement can be expandable, it allows to complete the message with more details while remaining compact by default. It can also simply be a link to another page of your store. A best practice is to keep the default announcement text short, and to preview the result on small screen before publishing.

### Social icons

In the announcement bar settings, you can enable the social icons. But your social accounts must also be properly set up. You do so by clicking on the “Theme settings” shortcut, and then going to the “Social media” tab).

### Announcement

Customize the announcement by selecting the “text block” in the main left sidebar. What you type in in the “Text” field will be displayed in the section. If you add a link, the bar will display an arrow to communicate to the user that the section is clickable. If you enable expandable content, this will override the link and display a dropdown button instead.
